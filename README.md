“Mad Libs” are short stories that have blanks called placeholders to be filled in.
You ask someone to fill in each of the placeholders without telling them anything about the overall story.
Once all placeholders are filled in, you show them the resulting silly story.

The app has three screens: a “welcome” screen explaining the app, then a screen that repeatedly prompts the user to fill in placeholders
and once the user has typed in replacements for all these placeholders, the completed story is shown on the screen.
